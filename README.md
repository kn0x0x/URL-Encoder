# URL Encoding & Decoding for CTF Challenges

This repository contains two Python scripts: `encode.py` and `decode.py`, which are used for encoding and decoding text using URL encoding. These scripts are useful for CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges and tasks involving URL encoding techniques.

## Files

- **`encode.py`**: Converts a given text into URL-encoded format.
- **`decode.py`**: Decodes a given URL-encoded string back to its original text.

## Usage

### 1. Encoding a string

To encode a string into URL-encoded format, run the `encode.py` script with the text you want to encode.

```bash
python3 encode.py "your_text_here"
